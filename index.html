<ol>
<li>Points would be awarded for each of the phases for a given subject, not just for the last phase </li>
<li>There would be a mutex lock on the subject in consideration (object in trap) by any of the stakeholders (Be a gentleman!)</li>
<li>A subject can be re-studied by another stakeholder, given the mutex is not locked on the subject</li>
<li>Mutex can be unlocked only by the stakeholder who locked it</li>
<li>Once a stakeholder involves with a new subject the mutex would be unlocked automatically on the previous subject being studied by the stakeholder</li>
<li>No additional points would be awarded for the same phase more than once with the same subject</li>
<li>One will only be awarded points for a maximum of 5 approaches (APP), further points would be locked until he clears stage 2 (CUD) with a subject, once he crosses stage 2, points in reserve would be awarded all at once</li>
<li>One can opt out of the project at any point in time, but he would loose his stake in the project completely</li>

Points would be awarded for each of the phases for a given subject, not just for the last phase \r\n1. There would be a mutex lock on the subject in consideration (object in trap) by any of the stakeholders (Be a gentleman!)\r\n1. A subject can be re-studied by another stakeholder, given the mutex is not locked on the subject\r\n1. Mutex can be unlocked only by the stakeholder who locked it\r\n1. Once a stakeholder involves with a new subject the mutex would be unlocked automatically on the previous subject being studied by the stakeholder\r\n1. No additional points would be awarded for the same phase more than once with the same subject\r\n1. One will only be awarded points for a maximum of 5 approaches (APP), further points would be locked until he clears stage 2 (CUD) with a subject, once he crosses stage 2, points in reserve would be awarded all at once\r\n1. One can opt out of the project at any point in time, but he would loose his stake in the project completely\r\n\r\n\r\n",
